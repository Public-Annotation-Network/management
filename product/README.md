# Public Annotation Network - PAN ðŸ¥˜

Public Annotation Network (PAN) is a censorship-resistent web annotation service.

## Product Concept

Our browser extensions, PAN, allow users to annotate on any web pages. Users can sign annotations with their Ethereum address and publish annotations to the network. Annotation data is stored on IPFS. For better compatibility with other services, we adopt [W3C's Web Annotation Data Model](https://www.w3.org/TR/annotation-model/). There are two ways to submit annotations, users can either publish annotations directly to our network or submit via a publisher, who will then publish annotations in batches on behalf of the users. At last, an Ethreum smart contract registry is used to store references to each annotation and its annotator, ensuring that annotation data is immutable.
