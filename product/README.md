# Public Annotation Network - PAN ðŸ¥˜

Public Annotation Network (PAN) is a censorship-resistent web annotation service.

## Product Concept

Our browser extensions, PAN, allow users to annotate on any web pages. Users can sign annotations with their Ethereum address and publish annotations to the network. The annotation data is compatible with [W3C's Web Annotation Data Model](https://www.w3.org/TR/annotation-model/) and is stored on IPFS, a decentralized storage system. An Ethreum smart contract registry is used to store references to each annotation and its autor.
