User Group 1: Readers, audience of the internet.

User Group 2: Annotators, commentators that gives explainations or opnions on web content. 


## Problems

(1) companies or governments can censor/manipulate the content presented to the audience
(2) comments on the websites are vulnerable to internet troll, which intends to skew the public opinion
