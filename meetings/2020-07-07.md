Scoping and Data Structures Meeting 07.07.20
============================================


Items since last call
---------------------

- provide a list of potential additions
- pick up meaningful features in future iterations
- keep features in mind as we develop to not reach a dead end
- keep current scope clean to a prototype level


Initial scoping
---------------

- start out with Rinkeby as it seems most stable
- *Problem:* verbosity of data structures
    - integrate custom data structures for max development speed, or
    - implement official W3C standard for maximum extensibility and futureproofing
- *Solution:*
    - implement the complete W3C web annotations standard for claims
    - use a subset of the features for the prototype for now
    - better extensibility, integrating other platforms becomes a simple frontend effort
- Strategy: expand to other platforms step by step
    - goal: integration into pre-existing platform usage patterns
    - easier onboarding of new users to annotation platform
- W3C claims standard reference: https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-use-cases/#example-verifiable-credentials
- use specific parts for annotations in `claims` property
    - more flexibility in more advanced use cases


Data structures
---------------

- *Annotation:* W3C annotation data model reference: https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/#example-1-a-simple-example-of-a-verifiable-credential
- *Receipt:*
    - batch id annotation will be included in
    - publisher signature over receipt data
- *Batch:*
    - publish batch's CID list on IPFS, get CID back, store that on smart contract registry
    - on API-level: list of CIDs, optionally resolved into annotation objs
    - once sealed, signature over batch from publisher


Terminology Proposal
--------------------

- PAN = Public Annotation Network
- pan = Public Annotation
- cook = publish annotation
- shelf = smart contract registry of annotations
- waiter = Publisher
- kitchen = browser extension/SaaS for interaction with the stack
- chef = annotator
- restaurant = annotations dashboard


Action Items
------------

- build data structure samples to kickstart development
- read up on standards and tech
- first start with SaaS-oriented approach, later expand into direct chain/IPFS interaction
- define specific stack technologies (IPFS, Ethereum)
- build use case diagram
- entities: Reader, Annotator, Publisher, (Court/Kleros)
- actions:
    - *Reader:*
        - list and filter annotations
        - verify annotations
    - *Annotator:*
        - sign annotations
        - publish annotations to the publisher
        - list and filter annotations
        - verify annotations
        - view publisher receipts
        - generate a key pair (or load an existing Ethereum key)
    - *Publisher:*
        - list and filter annotations
        - verify annotation
        - list pending batches
        - create and list publisher receipts
        - single or batch publishing mode:
            - store and pin annotations on IPFS
            - store annotation entry in Smart Contract registry
        - generate key pair
        - authenticate annotator


Future Action Items
-------------------

- implement billing engine in Publisher
- billing dashboard on Publisher
- revoke an annotation
- update an annotation
