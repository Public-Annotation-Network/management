## Decisions
- Make all the requests from the API
  - We prefer to do it this way so that we don't go over The Graph's limit on computation
  - By having the API resolve the annotation CIDs it can cache the requests, increasing the performance
- The web extension would not call the graph

## Updates
- We have a subgraph working: https://api.thegraph.com/subgraphs/name/public-annotation-network/subgraph
- We have the data structures defined: https://hackmd.io/LMKXmqBZS2iHfvEwyXYJbQ
- We have the branding in the works. Colors, logo and typography are done. Web page mockups to come next

## TODOs
- For Friday
    - API: 
        - GET /annotations?tweetId,userId
            - By querying the Graph and resolving the annotations CID, gotta work with IPFS
        - POST /annotations
            - Use The Graphâ€™s IPFS node to pin the annotations
    - Web extension
        - Create an annotation on a tweet page
        - Display annotations on tweet page
        - Method to authenticate users
    - Web app
        - User registration
        - User login 
        - User Auth Token generation
    - Website
        - Wireframes ready
    - The Graph
        - Allowing to submit annotation
        - Query annotations
